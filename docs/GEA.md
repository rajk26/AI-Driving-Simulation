# Goals, Environment, and Adaptation (for Final Project)

(From the Final write-up)
> You should fill out the GEA worksheet for the first Phase of this project. Within your _Environment_ section, I want you to layout who the stakeholders are for your system and reflect upon how your system may positively or negatively each of these stakeholders. You should use this as a part of your Final Report as well as your presentations.

1. Describe your system in terms of **goals**, **environment**, and **adaptations**. Also answer the following questions:
2. How could it enact problematic social systems/practices? How will your system get around those potential issues?

<br /><br />
This is meant to allow us to begin to bridge from designing independent of implementation, to designing along side implementation. This is also meant to have us think about how our AI systems are developed within existing social contexts.

Remember, you can draw pictures/diagrams to augment your words (for the **G**, **E**, and **A**).

### Adaptation

+ How might the system adapt to the environment given the goals? How might it's inner environment change?
